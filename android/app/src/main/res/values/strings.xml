    <string name="sessionSampleDescription">Kotlin has a lot of great features that improve developer productivity and make the overall code base more stable. This all works great when you\'re entire code base is written in Kotlin. However, while Kotlin adoption is growing by leaps and bounds, the fact is that many applications and libraries are still on Java and will be for some time. This means, if you\'re a library provider like Realm that 100k+ devlopers rely on, you must provide an API that works well for both platforms. In this talk, you\'ll learn about some of the challenges faced and approaches taken by Realm to solve this problem and how you might apply these same approaches to your own libraries. You\'ll also learn about some of the key Kotlin features they used to simplify Realm Mobile Database development with Kotlin.</string>
